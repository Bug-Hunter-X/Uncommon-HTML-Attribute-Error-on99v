This repository demonstrates an uncommon HTML error related to using attributes not officially supported by the HTML specification.  Some browsers might accept these non-standard attributes, but others will ignore them, resulting in inconsistencies in rendering and behavior across different browsers. The `bug.html` file shows the error, while `bugSolution.html` demonstrates a corrected approach.
